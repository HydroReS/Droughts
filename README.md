# Droughts
The functions in this repository consist of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) (McKee et al., 1993) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010; Beguería et al., 2014).

# SPI
Developed by (McKee et al., 1993), the Standardized Precipitation Index represents normalized deviations of accumulated precipitation relative to median conditions. The index is widely used for its simplicity and range of applicability. Among its main features, SPI allows the comparison of anomalously dry conditions in regions with different climatic conditions, in addition to its ability to measure wet conditions similarly.

# SPEI
The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI, (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010) incorporates the effects of temperature, and consequently global warming, in drought analysis. The index is similar to SPI, however it represents normalized deviations of the water balance instead of precipitation alone. The water balance is represented by the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration at a monthly scale.
